#Assigment ask me to:
Client output. As the client runs, for each line processed, the client will display what the 
operation was and its result. For example, starting from an empty tuple space, the output would 
be
PUT Manchester-United 20: OK (Manchester-United, 20) added
PUT Liverpool 19: OK (Liverpool, 19) added


and i also wanna know which client did this

so it look like this:
[Client-4(test-workload/client_4.txt)] PUT urinate pass after the manner of urine: OK (urinate, pass after the manner of urine) added
[Client-3(test-workload/client_3.txt)] PUT stem_blight a fungous blight attacking the stems of plants: ERR stem_blight already exists
